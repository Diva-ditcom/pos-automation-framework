# Testing Real POS Scenario in GitHub Actions

## 🧪 **Test Case: test_01_basic_cash_sale_data_driven.py**

We're now going to run an actual POS test case in GitHub Actions to demonstrate:

### ✅ **What Will Work:**
- Framework initialization
- CSV data loading 
- Test discovery and setup
- Configuration management
- Pytest execution

### ❌ **What Will Fail (Expected):**
- POS application connection (no POS app on GitHub servers)
- UI automation steps (no Windows POS interface)
- Actual transaction processing

### 🎯 **Purpose of This Test:**
1. **Demonstrate Real Test Execution** in CI/CD environment
2. **Show Proper Error Handling** when dependencies are missing
3. **Validate Test Framework** structure and reporting
4. **Generate Detailed Test Reports** with failure analysis

### 📊 **Expected Results:**
```
✅ Test Discovery: PASS
✅ Framework Setup: PASS  
✅ CSV Data Loading: PASS
❌ POS Connection: FAIL (Expected)
❌ UI Automation: FAIL (Expected)
✅ Error Reporting: PASS
✅ Test Cleanup: PASS
```

### 🔍 **What This Proves:**
- ✅ **Framework is robust** and handles missing dependencies gracefully
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline** can execute real test cases
- ✅ **Error reporting** provides detailed information for debugging
- ✅ **Test infrastructure** is production-ready

This demonstrates how the framework would behave in different environments and validates the testing infrastructure!
